**Meeting Summary 7/31/23**

Attendees: trix, jsteffan



1. **Updates**
    1. **[trix]**
        1. [Cpuinfo](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/cpuinfo) made it into rawhide
        2. [ https://github.com/trixirt/pytorch-fedora](https://github.com/trixirt/pytorch-fedora) has a starting spec
        3. Added ‘ROCm’ sheet to package spreadsheet
2. **Group purpose - Focus on pytorch software enablement, hardware enablement for acceleration**
    2. What other groups could be interested in pytorch? Where to combine forces?
        4. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/ML](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/ML)
        5. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Python](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Python)
        6. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/bigdata](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/bigdata)
        7. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DataEngineering](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DataEngineering)
        8. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/HC](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/HC)
        9. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora)
            1. This SIG has already walked some of the walk that we discussed today: [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/excludedfosstools/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/excludedfosstools/) 
            2. [https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/534](https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/534) 
        10. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:SciTech_SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:SciTech_SIG)  [https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/) This group has a pretty large SIG and already produces media (indicating a level a maturity past just a SIG)
        11. [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Grid_Computing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Grid_Computing) 
3. **Real time communication**
    3. **[jsteffan] **
        12. Work with FI to setup matrix pytorch channel with bridge to libera; expect slow response time as people are traveling for Flock
            3. FAS Group requests for shared package maintenance: [https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/11438](https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/11438) 
            4. Matrix channel creation w/bridge: [https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/11439](https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/11439) 
4. **How to get hardware into the right hands**
    4. How do we test hardware acceleration?
        13. Maybe FedoraQA runners? [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenQA](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenQA) 
        14. Maybe Fedora CI runners? [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/)
        15. “Fedora_release_autotest” supports running tests on the “beaker” RH test farm – maybe expand this for the hardware we are targeting?
        16. Tmt supports defining hardware requirements [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/tmt/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/tmt/) 
    5. How do we sponsor hardware for contributors? (or get lab access?)
    6. How do we do debugging and remain sane?
