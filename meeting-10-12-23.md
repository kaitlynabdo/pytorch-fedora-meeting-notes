    4. We are currently packaging for CPU-only and next goal is for ROCm
         - there were requests for packaging for other accelerators
2. **Packaging For other Accelerators**
    1. If you have a specific accelerator you want to package for, gather the list of dependencies and add them to the [Packaging Status WikiPage](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/PyTorch/packagingStatus)
    2. An accelerator section has been added to the table on WikiPage, include the name of the accelerator to any dependencies that you add.
